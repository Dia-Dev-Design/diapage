- Reload both apps: quit and reopen Figma Desktop, then reopen Cursor.
- Reconnect in Cursor and confirm the server shows "connected".
- Verify capabilities are listed; try a simple action (for example, get a screenshot).
- If still flaky:
  - Restart in order: Figma Desktop → MCP server → Cursor.
  - Remove and re-add the MCP server entry in Cursor.
  - Check Windows Firewall permissions if using socket transport.
  - Update Figma Desktop to the latest version.
