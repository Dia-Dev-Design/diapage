## 🚀 Quick Start: Your First MCP Component

### Step 1: Open Figma
- Open your mobile design file
- Enable Dev Mode
- Select the component frame you want to build
- Note the frame ID (shown in URL or Dev Mode)

### Step 2: Open Cursor (Background Mode)
Copy this prompt (customize the bracketed parts):

```
@figma-mcp Generate a mobile-responsive React component from Figma frame "[YOUR_FRAME_ID]" ([ComponentName]) with styled-components.

Target file: src/mobile/components/[ComponentName].jsx

Requirements:
- Use styled-components (no inline styles)
- Mobile-first layout: flexbox with flex-direction: column
- Responsive typography: use clamp() based on Figma specs
- Import assets from ../../assets/
- Colors: use var(--green) #65B47B, var(--gray) #b4a7bc
- Font families: "Aileron-Regular" (body), "Aileron-Bold" (headers)
- Touch-friendly: buttons min 48px height, :active states
- Box model: box-sizing: border-box

Ensure exact color matches and precise spacing from Figma Dev Mode.
```

### Step 3: Test
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open browser, resize < 1024px, check component

### Step 4: Validate
```
@figma-mcp Compare [ComponentName].jsx against Figma frame "[FRAME_ID]" and list any discrepancies
```

### Step 5: Refine
Use Template 4 from `mcp-prompt-templates.md` to fix any issues

## 💡 Best Practices Recap

### When to Use Each Document

1. **Starting a new component?**
   → `FIGMA_MCP_WORKFLOW.md` (Phase 1-4)

2. **Need a quick MCP command?**
   → `.cursor/figma-mcp-quick-reference.md`

3. **What colors/fonts should I use?**
   → `DESIGN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md`

4. **Writing an MCP prompt?**
   → `.cursor/mcp-prompt-templates.md` (copy Template 1-10)

5. **Fixing a style mismatch?**
   → Template 4 in `mcp-prompt-templates.md`

6. **Validating against Figma?**
   → Template 5 in `mcp-prompt-templates.md`

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Understanding Your Tools
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Connects Cursor to Figma API
- **Dev Mode in Figma:** Provides CSS specs and measurements
- **Styled-Components:** CSS-in-JS for React with component-scoped styles
- **Clamp():** CSS function for responsive typography (min, preferred, max)
- **DeviceSetter:** Your custom solution for device-specific rendering

### Figma → Code Translation
```
Figma Frame → MCP reads specs → Generates React + styled-components → You refine in Cursor
```

---

## 🤝 Collaboration Tips

### For Designers:
- Keep mobile frames organized in Figma
- Use Dev Mode to verify specs before handing off
- Name layers clearly (e.g., "MobileHeaderTitle")
- Export assets to standard formats (SVG for icons)

### For Developers:
- Always start from Figma (designer's truth)
- Use MCP for initial generation (saves time)
- Validate against Figma after implementation
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Document any design deviations in PR/commit

---

## 📞 Getting Help

### If MCP isn't working as expected:
1. Check `.cursor/figma-mcp-quick-reference.md` - troubleshooting section
2. Review `FIGMA_MCP_WORKFLOW.md` - Phase 2 (MCP generation)
3. Try fallback: Use Figma plugins (Anima, Locofy) then refine in Cursor
4. Verify MCP connection in Cursor settings

### If styles don't match Figma:
1. Use Template 5 (Validate Implementation) to identify discrepancies
2. Use Template 4 (Fix Style Discrepancy) for each issue
3. Check `DESIGN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md` for standard patterns
4. Compare in browser with DevTools side-by-side with Figma
